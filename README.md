### Project

**Project:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix Dataset

**Objective:** 
Perform a comprehensive EDA on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights related to content diversity, audience targeting, and genre preferences.

## Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Key Activities

### 1. Imported Libraries

The first step in any data analysis project is importing the necessary libraries. For this project, the following libraries are used:

- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
- **numpy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.
- **seaborn:** A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **matplotlib:** A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### 2. Loaded the Netflix Data

Loading the dataset is a crucial step. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, which provides various functionalities to explore and manipulate the data. This step typically involves reading a CSV file or other data formats:

```python
import pandas as pd
netflix_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_netflix_dataset.csv')
```

### 3. Analyzed the Data

Once the data is loaded, the next step is to get an understanding of its structure and contents. This involves several basic exploration commands:

- **head() and tail():** These functions are used to view the first few and last few rows of the dataset, respectively, giving a quick glimpse into the data.

    ```python
    print(netflix_data.head())
    print(netflix_data.tail())
    ```

- **info():** This function provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries and the data types of each column.

    ```python
    print(netflix_data.info())
    ```

- **shape:** This attribute returns the dimensions of the DataFrame, showing the number of rows and columns.

    ```python
    print(netflix_data.shape)
    ```

### 4. Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This involves:

- **Finding Duplicates:** Identifying and handling duplicate entries to ensure the dataset's integrity.

    ```python
    duplicates = netflix_data.duplicated()
    print(duplicates.sum())
    ```

- **Handling Missing Values:** Checking for missing values and deciding on a strategy to handle them, such as removing rows/columns or imputing values.

    ```python
    missing_values = netflix_data.isnull().sum()
    print(missing_values)
    ```

- **Replacing Missing Values:** Depending on the analysis requirements, missing values can be replaced with appropriate values, like the mean, median, or mode.

    ```python
    netflix_data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
    ```

### 5. Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial part of EDA, providing insights that are not immediately obvious from the raw data. Different types of plots are used to explore various aspects of the data:

- **Histogram:** Shows the distribution of a single numeric variable.

    ```python
    netflix_data['column_name'].hist()
    ```

- **Bar Chart:** Used to compare different categories of data.

    ```python
    netflix_data['column_name'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
    ```

- **Pie Chart:** Displays the proportion of categories in a dataset.

    ```python
    netflix_data['column_name'].value_counts().plot(kind='pie')
    ```

- **Heatmap:** A matrix plot that shows the correlation between different variables.

    ```python
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    sns.heatmap(netflix_data.corr(), annot=True)
    plt.show()
    ```

- **Line Plot:** Useful for showing trends over time.

    ```python
    netflix_data.plot(x='date_column', y='numeric_column', kind='line')
    ```

- **Scatter Plot:** Displays the relationship between two numeric variables.

    ```python
    netflix_data.plot(x='column1', y='column2', kind='scatter')
    ```

- **Pair Plot:** Plots pairwise relationships in a dataset.

    ```python
    sns.pairplot(netflix_data)
    ```

- **FacetGrid:** Used for plotting conditional relationships.

    ```python
    g = sns.FacetGrid(netflix_data, col="column_name")
    g.map(plt.hist, "another_column")
    ```

##  6. Observations / Insights

#### Global Content Diversity

The dataset represents content from a diverse range of countries, including prominent contributions from the United States, South Africa, and India. This diversity reflects a global approach to content acquisition and audience targeting.

#### Shift Towards Streaming TV Shows

There is a noticeable trend towards streaming TV shows, as indicated by the prevalence of multiple seasons listed in the dataset. This suggests a strategic focus on episodic content to cater to binge-watching habits.

#### Audience Targeting by Rating

The predominant rating category in the dataset is 'TV-MA', indicating a focus on mature audiences. This strategic choice likely aligns with viewer demographics and content preferences on the platform.

#### Recent Content Emphasis

A significant portion of the content was added or released in recent years, particularly around 2020 and 2021. This reflects a strategy of acquiring and showcasing recent productions to maintain viewer engagement with up-to-date content.

#### Genre Preferences and Diversity

The dataset covers a wide array of genres, including documentaries, international TV shows, dramas, and crime series. This genre diversity caters to varied viewer interests and ensures a broad appeal across different demographics and preferences.
